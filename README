Welcome to the Newt library

Description

Newt is a perl library built on top of Red Hat's newt C library for
text screen widgets. It allows a perl programer to build simple but
effective text-mode user interfaces with little effort.

It is very usable because it has complete support for all widgets
found in newt 0.30, and provides a nice abstraction over the C
interface. Documentation is mostly complete, but I'm sure its
perfectible.

To do

Well, correct any bugs, of course, but I'm mostly concern by the fact
that AutoSplit won't split Newt.pm in perl versions below 5.002. If
you can help me to fix this, I'll be grateful.

Prerequisites

You need perl 5.002_02 in order to compile this, and just because old
AutoSplit modules will reject the use of multiple packages in one
module. Perhaps I should fix this to work on older perls, don't know.
You also need a correctly installed slang library version 0.99, and a
popt library 1.1.x to compile this software. There are rpms for this
in your favorite repository.

How to install

Unpack your distribution on some directory, then cd to it and issue
the following commands:

   $ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make 
   $ make test
   $ make install


Help wanted!

If you have any ideas, patches or anything, please send them to me
(amedina@msg.com.mx).
